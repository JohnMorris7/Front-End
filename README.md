# SaveThePrincess
A text based adventure game featuring zombies.
# Passion Project: Save the Princess

Text based adventure game where a knight is challenged to complete riddles, puzzles, and ultimately save the princess against evil demon zombies that kidnapped her. 

There will be a maze full of enemies that he will have to fight by inputting commands. The player decides the direction he has to go by selecting one of four directions through inputting numbers.

There is a system that calculates a playerâ€™s health and stamina. Stamina is dependent on random occurrences that can happen to a player such as damaging obstacles within the maze, choosing to fight vs choosing to run, or falling sick. If a player does not have enough stamina to fight, he will take damage and possibly die. There are chests in the maze that contain items such as health potions, antidotes for sickness, and different weapons that have varying attack power. 

This will be created using Spring, Java, and Angular. 

Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime! Complete with twists, turns, and multiple endings. Can you save the princess?
